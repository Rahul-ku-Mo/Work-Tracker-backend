# Authentication & Team Fixes Summary

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **"Failed to create team" Error During Login**
- **Problem**: Frontend was trying to create teams via `/teams` endpoint but backend routes weren't properly configured
- **Fix**: 
  - Corrected team routes import in `routes/index.js` to use `team.routes.js`
  - Updated auth controller to include team data in login responses
  - Users now get team information automatically when logging in

### 2. **Missing Team in Seed Data**
- **Problem**: Seed script only created users and boards, no team structure
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated `seedRealisticCards.js` to create a complete team structure
  - Created "TechCorp Development Team" with join code `DEMO2024`
  - Alex Chen is set as team captain with admin permissions
  - All users are properly linked to the team via `teamId`

### 3. **Team Member Limit (Max 5 including admin)**
- **Problem**: No limit enforcement in seed data
- **Fix**: 
  - Reduced team members from 6 to 5 (including admin)
  - Redistributed card assignments among remaining 5 members
  - Team now has exactly 5 members as required

### 4. **Improved Error Messages**
- **Problem**: Generic error messages for auth failures
- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling in `auth.controller.js`:
  - **Signup errors**: Specific messages for duplicate email/username
  - **Google OAuth errors**: Detailed error handling for different failure scenarios
  - **Database errors**: User-friendly messages instead of technical error details
