- **Rate Limiter**: Rate limiter middleware is implemented to protect against brute-force attacks and ensure the stability of the application.
- **Redis**: Redis is used as a caching layer to improve performance and scalability.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for storing application data.
- **Prisma**: Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) used for database access and management.
- **Docker**: Docker is used for containerization, enabling easy deployment and scaling of the application.
