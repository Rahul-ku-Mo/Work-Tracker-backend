# Fix for Due Date Clear Issue

## Problem
Due dates were not being properly cleared when users clicked "Clear due date" buttons. The dates remained the same (e.g., "2025-06-11T00:31:31.643Z") even though the frontend showed the clear operation as successful.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the backend `card.controller.js` file, specifically in the `updateCard` function on line 109:

**Original (Buggy) Code:**
```javascript
dueDate: dueDate ? new Date(dueDate) : currentCard.dueDate,
```

**Problem with the Logic:**
- When `dueDate` is `null` (clear operation), the condition `dueDate ? ...` evaluates to `false`
- This caused the code to fall back to `currentCard.dueDate` instead of setting it to `null`
- So the due date was never actually cleared in the database

## Solution
Changed the logic to properly handle the three cases:

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
dueDate: dueDate !== undefined ? (dueDate ? new Date(dueDate) : null) : currentCard.dueDate,
```

**New Logic:**
1. **`dueDate` is `undefined`** → Don't update, keep current due date
2. **`dueDate` is `null`** → Clear the due date (set to null in database)
3. **`dueDate` has a value** → Set to the new date

## Additional Frontend Fix
Also updated the TypeScript type definition to properly allow `null` values:

**Before:**
```typescript
dueDate?: Date;
```

**After:**
```typescript
dueDate?: Date | null;
```

## Files Changed
1. `backend/controllers/card.controller.js` - Fixed the due date logic
2. `frontend/src/_components/Card/_mutations/useCardMutations.ts` - Updated type definition

## Testing the Fix
To verify the fix works:

1. **Set a due date** on any card
2. **Clear the due date** using either:
   - The clear button in the card popover
   - The clear button in the right panel
3. **Verify the due date is actually removed** from the database
4. **Refresh the page** to confirm the due date doesn't reappear

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Due date clears immediately in the UI
- ✅ Due date is set to `null` in the database  
- ✅ Page refresh shows no due date
- ✅ Clear button only appears when due date exists
- ✅ All clear methods work consistently

## Notes
- This fix maintains backward compatibility
- The logic properly handles all edge cases
- Both frontend clear methods (card footer and right panel) now work correctly
- The fix ensures database consistency with UI state
